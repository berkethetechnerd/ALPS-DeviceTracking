### What is ALPS & Device Tracking?

The goal of Automated Licensing Payment Systems (ALPS) is to enhance accuracy and trust and reduce uncertainty as well as overall transaction costs in the licensing of Intellectual Property (IP). The system enables novel business models and contributes to fairer remuneration of the IP owners for the value their assets generate in the industry.   

Most currently, an automated licensing payment system (ALPS) is being developed by a team of scholars, students and industry experts combining expertise from Technology Management, Innovation and Intellectual Property. This system will include digital infrastructure that enables the automated calculation, execution and verification of accurate payments from licensees and their customers to licensors.   

As a contributor to this project, we develop an Android application which collects usage time of some sensors on Android Smart Phones e.g. Bluetooth, Wifi, Screen activation, etc. After that, the application sends this usage data to an already created and ready simulated DLT. This will enable more thorough and realistic testing scenarios.
