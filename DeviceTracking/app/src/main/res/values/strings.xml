    <string name="login_title">WELCOME</string>
    <string name="login_disclaimer">This is an application developed for a research project conducted
        by the Engineering Department, University of Cambridge,  sponsored by Research England’s
        Connecting Capability Fund award CCF18-7157 - Promoting the Internet of Things via Collaboration
        between HEIs and Industry (Pitch-In).

        \n\nThis app has been specifically developed as part of the research project “Prototyping an
        IoT platform for automated IP licensing payments”. Further details are available here:
        <a>https://pitch-in.ac.uk/projects/ip-licensing-platform/</a>

        \n\nData from all users that choose to participate in this research project will be used to
        improve a simulation prototype for usage-based licensing models in the digital economy.

        \n\nThis application will be anonymously recording in the background device usage data for
        the following features of your mobile phone: Bluetooth, Screentime, Wifi, GPS, NFC and Torch.
        The data will be sent regularly to our UK-based servers, where it is stored unassociated with
        any personal data.

        \n\nTo start using the application, please hit the \'Next\' button.
